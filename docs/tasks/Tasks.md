# Task Backlog

Inbox for new tasks. A human adds an entry; the AI turns it into a task file. See
`README.md` for how. The rules come from the `task` plugin, not from this
directory.

The frontmatter above is this project's configuration. `create_branch` decides
whether a task may have its own branch; `create_pull_request` decides whether
reaching `in_review` opens a pull request on GitHub, or a merge request on GitLab.
Each key is a ceiling: `false` takes the thing away from every task, whatever else
is written down. Edit them here and the next task follows them.

Entry format: `### [<kind>: ]<short title> [<status>, <priority>]` plus a short
explanation. Once the AI has created the task file, it adds a `file: <link>` line
under the heading and keeps the brackets up to date as the status changes. An entry
is removed when its task is cleaned, so this file shows open work only.

Keep a heading short and plain: it becomes the task file's name, and the branch
name when the project uses branches.

Statuses:

* `draft` - written down, not planned yet.
* `planning` - a human asked the AI to plan it.
* `planned` - cleared to implement. Either a plan is written and waiting for a
  human to verify it, or you set `planned` yourself **with no plan** in the task
  file, which waives the plan and tells the AI to go straight to the code.
* `in_progress` - the AI is implementing it.
* `in_review` - the implementation is ready, waiting for review.
* `changes_requested` - review asked for changes.
* `approved` - review passed, ready to land.
* `done` - merged, or committed on `main` when the project uses no branches.

Priorities: `high` | `medium` | `low`.
